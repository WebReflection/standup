# Andrea Giammarchi Standup

This repository includes daily or weekly summaries around my current focus or things I am working on.

It's a personal diary related to my work, but it could as well include details around Web standards contributions (WHATWG, TC39, others ...) or Python PEPXXX related effort/contributions and whatnot.

<sup>In short: this is a space for me to describe my journey as OSS employee / contributor.</sup>

ℹ️ this is an experiment so far, but I am enjoying it already and I hope somebody, somewhere, one day will benefit from it 👋
